# surfs_up

## Overview
This analysis is will help W. Avy make decisions on if a surf and ice cream shop should be opened in Oahu. It will focus on historical temperature and precipitation data to determine if Oahu is the best place to open the shop.

- There is not much fluctiation in temperature over the course of the same month in Oahu.
- Most days throughout either month are warm enough for surfing. The coldest days of either are probably too cold to surf but don't happen that often
- All days of either month are warm enough for ice cream. Customers might just need to wear a jacket on the colder days.

## Summary
The results show based on June and December data that Oahu is a good location for a surf and ice cream shop. Some additional information that might be useful might be write a query that shows the average temperature by month. Then make a comparison of the month with the lowest average temperature to the month with the highest average temperature. The assumption being that if the temperature is good for those months all the other months will be acceptable as well.

Also some visualizations of the June and December data might make decision making easier.
